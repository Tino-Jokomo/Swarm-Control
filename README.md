# Swarm-Control
Decentralised Swarm Conrol with MQTT

The purpose of this is to allow a swarm of drones to communicate and send data through mqtt to each other. This code uses python however mqtt is available in different languages and the algorithms presented in this repo serve as examples that may be extended with other software for various use. Additionally dronekit libraries were used to perform some functionality for simplified integration.
